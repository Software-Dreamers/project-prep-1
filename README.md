The strategy to ensure that everyoneâ€™s voice is heard is by having honest feedback on how everyone is doing.

We will ensure that we are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up by being empathetic on each other and also make sure we are all on the same page.

Github will be used is the project management tool.

## Git Process

HTML, CSS, JS will the be components on Github.

We are all collaborators so we will have copies of the repos.

The Git flow will be main and put everything on the staging branch with a new name and then each day have one branch per person merge our work by person.

Have all group members review the PRs. Won't merge our own code. At the end of the day we will merge. Commnicate in remo when it is time to merge.
